<h1 align=center>Description</h1>
<p>These are C++ libraries of Algorithm and Data Structure</p>
<p>these libraries have: vector, list, stack, queue, binarytree, iterator and matrix</p>

<h2 align=left>Vector and list</h2>
<p>Just a simple implementation of vector and list</p>

<h2 align=left>Queue and stack</h2>
<p>Here you can find the Queue implemented by vector and by list (Quevec and Quelist), and Stack implemented by vector and by list (Stackvec and Stacklst)</p>

<h2 align=left>Binarytree and Iterator</h2>
<p>Here you can find binarytree implemented by link and by vector, and the implementation of Iterator (for iterable structures)</p>
  
<h2 align=left>BST</h2>
<p>Here you can find the implementation of Binary Search Tree</p>
 
<h2 align=left>Matrix</h2>
<p>Here you can find Matrix implemented by Vector (classic) and by csr (Compressed Sparse Row)</p>

<h2 align=left>Testing</h2>
<p>Testing of all the methods of the library</p>
